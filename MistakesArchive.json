      "Mistake_Title": "Falling for Potential, Not Reality",
      "Mistake_Details": "You saw what she could be, not who she actually was. You kept hoping she'd grow, change, or finally commit — but people only change if they truly want to. Falling for potential often leaves you stuck in a fantasy, not a relationship.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Ignoring Red Flags Because of Chemistry",
      "Mistake_Details": "The spark was strong, but the signs were louder. You laughed off the excuses, the mixed signals, the inconsistencies — because the attraction felt so real. Chemistry is exciting, but it's not a replacement for compatibility or respect.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Texting Like You're Already Her Girlfriend",
      "Mistake_Details": "You gave emotional availability before she gave commitment. Over-texting, over-sharing, and over-caring too soon can make you feel drained when things don't progress. Emotional investment should match effort and clarity — not assumptions.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Catching Feelings for Someone Unavailable",
      "Mistake_Details": "She had a girlfriend, wasn't ready, or was already involved with someone else. You convinced yourself that waiting was love, that eventually she'd choose you. This only led to heartbreak, resentment, and wasted emotional energy on someone who couldn't give you what you needed.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Changing Yourself to Fit Her Preferences",
      "Mistake_Details": "You cut your hair the way she liked it, ditched hobbies she didn't enjoy, and adjusted your personality to seem more compatible. But relationships aren't meant to erase who you are — they're meant to celebrate it. When you lose yourself, you lose the person she actually fell for.",

      "Mistake_Details": "You knew hooking up with her was a bad idea, but the chemistry was there. When it ended, so did your friendship — and half your social circle took sides. The aftermath lingered for years, creating tension in every group hangout.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Not Communicating Your Needs Directly",
      "Mistake_Details": "You dropped hints, used tone, and expected her to read between the lines. When she didn't understand what you wanted, you got upset that she 'didn't care.' But she can't meet needs she doesn't know you have. Hints are just miscommunication in disguise.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Comparing Your Relationship to Others",
      "Mistake_Details": "You scrolled through Instagram and saw other couples getting flowers daily, fancy dates, and public declarations of love. Your relationship looked boring by comparison, so you started resenting her for not doing the same. But those curated moments aren't reality — they're performance.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Not Respecting Her Boundaries or Personal Space",
      "Mistake_Details": "She asked for alone time, but you felt rejected. She set a boundary, but you pushed back because 'it wasn't a big deal.' You monitored who she spent time with and got jealous of her friendships. Boundaries aren't punishment — they're basic respect.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Staying Because You're Afraid of Starting Over",
      "Mistake_Details": "Deep down, you knew she wasn't the one. But the thought of being alone, rebuilding, and putting yourself back out there felt worse than staying comfortable in an unfulfilling relationship. Fear kept you stuck, stealing years you could've spent finding someone who actually loves you.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Playing Games Instead of Being Honest",
      "Mistake_Details": "You made her jealous on purpose, ignored her texts to seem less interested, or played hard to get to keep her chasing. Games are exhausting and they don't build trust — they build resentment. Real connection requires vulnerability, not strategy.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Losing Yourself in Her World Completely",

      "Mistake_Title": "Not Setting Standards for How You're Treated",
      "Mistake_Details": "She was late to every date, flaked on plans, and disrespected your time. You accepted it because you didn't want to seem demanding or difficult. But accepting poor treatment teaches people that they can treat you poorly.",

    "Mistake13": {
      "Mistake_Title": "Seeking Validation Through Her Approval",
      "Mistake_Details": "Everything you did was filtered through whether she'd like it or approve of it. You changed your outfit, canceled plans with friends, and made decisions based on her reaction. Your worth became tied to her opinion.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Staying in the Relationship for the Wrong Reasons",
      "Mistake_Details": "You stayed because of the history, because you'd invested so much time, or because leaving felt like admitting failure. But history isn't a reason to stay — it's just a reason you've already been there. Time invested in the wrong person is still time wasted.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Oversharing Too Soon",
      "Mistake_Details": "You told her your deepest secrets, your trauma, your insecurities on the third date. You thought vulnerability was intimacy, but you gave her ammunition before you gave her trust. Oversharing too early can feel like pressure, not connection.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Not Listening When She Showed You Who She Was",
      "Mistake_Details": "She told you upfront that she wasn't looking for anything serious, but you thought you'd change her mind. She showed you inconsistency, and you believed the good moments meant she was different with you. She showed you exactly who she was — you just didn't want to see it.",

      "Mistake_Details": "She pressured you into physical intimacy before you were ready, and you went along with it to avoid disappointing her or losing her. Your body told you no, but your fear said yes. That's not consent — that's compliance.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Confusing Attention with Love",
      "Mistake_Details": "She called you constantly, wanted to know where you were, and got upset when you had time away. You thought it was passion — it was possession. Control dressed up as care is still control.",

      "Mistake_Details": "Something bothered you, but you let it slide because you didn't want conflict. Then it happened again, and you stayed silent. By the time you finally spoke up, you were furious and she had no idea why. Small problems become big resentments when left untreated.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Making Excuses for Her Behavior",
      "Mistake_Details": "She stood you up and blamed work, so you accepted it. She was mean and blamed stress. She lied and blamed not wanting to hurt you. Every time, you found a reason to forgive and forget. But excuses aren't explanations — they're ways to avoid accountability.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Using the Silent Treatment as Punishment",
      "Mistake_Details": "When she upset you, you went silent. You didn't answer calls, gave one-word responses, and made her feel like she had to earn your forgiveness. Silent treatment is emotional punishment, and it teaches her that conflict means abandonment.",

      "Mistake_Details": "You mentioned how your ex was more affectionate, more fun, or more supportive. You thought it would motivate her to be better, but instead it made her feel like she'd never measure up. Comparisons kill connection.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Being Emotionally Unavailable When She Needed You",
      "Mistake_Details": "She opened up about her struggles and you shut down. When she needed emotional support, you were cold or dismissive. You showed up physically but checked out emotionally. That's not partnership.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Not Respecting Her Decision to Leave",
      "Mistake_Details": "When she said she needed a break or wanted to end things, you pushed back instead of accepting it. You tried to convince her, bargain with her, or manipulate her into staying. You didn't respect her autonomy.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Creating Drama to Avoid Boredom",
      "Mistake_Details": "When things felt routine or stable, you picked a fight to create excitement. You thrived on conflict and chaos because peace felt boring. But healthy relationships need stability, not constant turbulence.",

      "Mistake_Title": "Confusing Intensity with Depth",

      "Mistake_Details": "When you were upset, she had to fix it. When you were anxious, she had to calm you down. You never developed your own coping skills — you just leaned on her to manage your feelings. That's emotional labor you can't ask someone else to carry forever.",

      "Mistake_Lesson": "Honesty might hurt now, but dishonesty destroys everything later.",
